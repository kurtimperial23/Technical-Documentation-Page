                            Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't
                            taste sweetness. Cats are nearsighted, but their
                            peripheral vision and night vision are much better
                            than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18
                            toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each
                            back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their
                            length.

                            the world. They are domesticated mammals that are
                            often kept as pets or used for various purposes such
                            as hunting, herding, guarding, and assisting people
                            with disabilities. Dogs come in a variety of shapes,
                            sizes, and colors, and can range from small lap dogs
                            to large working breeds.

                            Snakes are a diverse group of reptiles that are
                            found on every continent except Antarctica. They
                            come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and
                            range from small, harmless species to large,
                            venomous predators. Snakes are characterized by
                            their long, slender bodies and lack of legs, which
                            allows them to move in a unique serpentine motion.
